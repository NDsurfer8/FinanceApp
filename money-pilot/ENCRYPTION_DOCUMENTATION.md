# VectorFi Encryption Documentation

## App Information

- **App Name**: VectorFi
- **Bundle ID**: com.ndsurf888.vectorfii
- **Platform**: iOS
- **Version**: 1.0.9

## Encryption Overview

VectorFi uses encryption to protect sensitive financial data stored on users' devices. This encryption is implemented to ensure the privacy and security of users' financial information.

## Encryption Implementation Details

### 1. Encryption Library

- **Library**: `react-native-crypto-js` (version 1.0.0)
- **Purpose**: AES encryption for sensitive financial data
- **Standard**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

### 2. Encryption Scope

The following data types are encrypted:

- **Financial Transactions**: Income, expenses, and transaction details
- **Assets**: Bank accounts, investments, and other assets
- **Debts**: Loans, credit cards, and other liabilities
- **Financial Goals**: Savings goals and progress tracking
- **Budget Settings**: User-defined budget parameters
- **Net Worth Entries**: Historical net worth data
- **Emergency Fund Data**: Emergency fund tracking information

### 3. Encryption Process

#### Key Generation

- Encryption keys are generated using a cryptographically secure random string generator
- Keys are 32 characters long, containing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Keys are stored securely in AsyncStorage with a specific storage key

#### Data Encryption

1. Financial data is converted to JSON format
2. Data is encrypted using AES encryption with the generated key
3. Encrypted data is stored in Firebase Realtime Database
4. Original unencrypted data is also stored for Firebase validation

#### Data Decryption

1. Encrypted data is retrieved from Firebase
2. Data is decrypted using the stored encryption key
3. Decrypted JSON is parsed back to original format
4. Fallback mechanisms ensure data integrity if decryption fails

### 4. Security Measures

#### Key Management

- Encryption keys are generated per device
- Keys are stored locally in AsyncStorage
- Keys are not transmitted to external servers
- Keys are not shared between users

#### Data Protection

- All sensitive financial data is encrypted before storage
- Encryption is applied at the field level for granular protection
- Original data is maintained for Firebase validation
- Decryption failures are handled gracefully with fallback mechanisms

#### User Privacy

- Users can enable/disable encryption in app settings
- Encryption status is clearly communicated to users
- No encryption keys are shared or transmitted
- Data remains encrypted during transmission

## Compliance Information

### Standard Encryption

- **Algorithm**: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Implementation**: Industry-standard `react-native-crypto-js` library
- **Key Length**: 32-character keys with mixed character sets
- **Purpose**: Protecting user financial data privacy

### Non-Exempt Status

This app uses non-exempt encryption because:

1. Custom encryption implementation beyond Apple's built-in security
2. Third-party encryption library (`react-native-crypto-js`)
3. Financial data protection requirements
4. User-configurable encryption settings

## User Communication

### Privacy Policy

The app's privacy policy clearly states:

- Financial data is encrypted for user privacy
- Encryption can be enabled/disabled by users
- No encryption keys are shared or transmitted
- Data protection measures are implemented

### User Interface

- Encryption status is displayed in Privacy & Security settings
- Users can toggle encryption on/off
- Clear messaging about data protection
- Transparent about encryption usage

## Technical Implementation

### Files Involved

- `src/services/encryption.ts` - Main encryption service
- `src/services/userData.ts` - Data encryption/decryption calls
- `src/screens/PrivacySecurityScreen.tsx` - User encryption controls

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "react-native-crypto-js": "^1.0.0"
}
```

## Conclusion

VectorFi implements encryption to protect user financial data privacy. The encryption uses industry-standard AES encryption through the `react-native-crypto-js` library. All sensitive financial data is encrypted before storage, and users have control over encryption settings. The implementation follows security best practices and maintains user privacy while ensuring data integrity.

This encryption implementation is necessary for protecting sensitive financial information and providing users with confidence in their data security.
