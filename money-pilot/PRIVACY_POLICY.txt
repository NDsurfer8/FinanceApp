PRIVACY POLICY

This privacy policy applies to the VectorFi app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by VectorFi (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as:

• Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
• The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
• The time spent on the Application
• The operating system you use on your mobile device
• Financial data including transactions, assets, debts, and goals
• Bank account information (when connected via Plaid)
• Biometric authentication preferences (Face ID/Touch ID settings)
• Push notification preferences and interaction data

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to support@vectorfi.ai. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

AI SERVICES AND DATA PROCESSING

The Application uses artificial intelligence services to provide personalized financial advice and analysis. When you use the AI financial advisor feature, your financial data (including income, expenses, assets, debts, and goals) may be processed by AI services to generate personalized recommendations and financial plans.

This financial data is encrypted and transmitted securely to our AI processing services. The AI analysis helps provide insights about your spending patterns, savings opportunities, debt management strategies, and financial goal planning.

Your financial data is processed solely for the purpose of providing you with personalized financial advice and is not used for any other commercial purposes without your explicit consent.

BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION

The Application may use Face ID or Touch ID for secure authentication to protect your financial information. When you enable biometric authentication, the Application stores your biometric preferences locally on your device.

Biometric data (fingerprint or facial recognition data) is processed by your device's secure enclave and is never transmitted to our servers or stored in our systems. The Application only stores your preference to use biometric authentication, not the actual biometric data itself.

You can disable biometric authentication at any time through the Application's settings, and this will immediately stop the use of biometric data for authentication.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS

The Application sends push notifications for important financial reminders, including bill due dates, budget alerts, and financial goal updates. To provide these notifications, the Application may collect and process:

• Bill due dates and amounts
• Budget spending thresholds
• Financial goal progress updates
• Notification interaction data (opens, dismissals)

You can control notification preferences through your device settings or within the Application's notification settings. You may opt out of push notifications at any time.

FINANCIAL DATA SECURITY

The Application processes sensitive financial information and employs industry-standard security measures to protect your data:

• All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
• Bank connections are secured through Plaid's bank-level security
• Financial data is stored in secure, encrypted databases
• Access to your financial data requires authentication

When you connect your bank accounts through Plaid, your banking credentials are never stored in our systems. Plaid uses bank-level security protocols to ensure your banking information remains secure.

THIRD PARTY ACCESS

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services that have their own Privacy Policy about handling data. Below are the links to the Privacy Policy of the third-party service providers used by the Application:

• Google Analytics for Firebase
• Firebase Crashlytics
• Expo
• RevenueCat
• Plaid
• OpenAI (for AI financial advice)
• Apple Authentication (Sign in with Apple)

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

• as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
• when they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
• with their trusted services providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

OPT-OUT RIGHTS

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

DATA RETENTION POLICY

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. Financial data used for AI analysis is retained only for the duration of your active session and is not stored for long-term AI training purposes.

If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them at support@vectorfi.ai and they will respond in a reasonable time. You may also request deletion of any AI-processed financial data.

CHILDREN

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case the Service Provider discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, the Service Provider will immediately delete this from their servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact the Service Provider (support@vectorfi.ai) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

SECURITY

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

All financial data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption protocols. Bank connections are secured through Plaid's bank-level security infrastructure. AI processing of financial data is conducted through secure, encrypted channels to ensure your financial information remains protected.

CHANGES

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
